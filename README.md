# Learning_FSharp
Repo to learn functional language F#

Learning F# basing on book "Programming F# 3.0, 2nd edition" by Chris Smith.
I split learning into lesson using my own convention:

- Solution "FirstThingsFirst" covers Chapters 1 - 3 of "Part I, Multi-Paradigm Programming" (pages 1 - 90)
- Solution "OtherParadigms" covers Chapters 4 - 6 of "Part I, Multi-Paradigm Programming" (pages 91 - 165)
